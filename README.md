# 💎⛏️ Minecraft API - Documentation 💎⛏️

Welcome to the **Minecraft API**! This project provides a RESTful API and a frontend interface to access detailed information about Minecraft entities such as blocks, mobs, items, biomes, structures, and more.

> 🚨 **Note:** This is a read-only API. All endpoints are `GET` methods only. The purpose is to provide Minecraft-related data to the community and developers.
> 
> 🚨 **UNOFFICIAL:** Also, this Minecraft API is not official for the game, it has no relationship with Mojang, it is simply used for informational purposes for the community.

## ⚒️ Introduction

The Minecraft API allows you to retrieve structured data on several Minecraft elements, including:

- Advancements
- Biomes
- Blocks
- Items
- Mobs
- Structures

The project consists of two parts:

- A **frontend** application to explore and visualize the data.
- A **backend** API that serves the data.

## 💎 API Routes

The following routes are available for each Minecraft entity:

### Entity endpoints
- `/api/advancements`
- `/api/biomes`
- `/api/blocks`
- `/api/items`
- `/api/mobs`
- `/api/structures`

### Generic sub-endpoints for each entity
- `/` – Get all data entries
- `/count` – Get the total count
- `/keys` – Show available keys
- `/:id` – Get a specific entry by ID
- `/:id/image` – Get image associated with entry
- `/all/:key` – Show all entries with the specified key
- `/all/:key/:value` – Filter entries by key and value
- `/:id/:key` – Get the value of a key for a specific entry

Example:  
```bash
GET /api/blocks/stone
```
